There are many python files for this project, decision_tree.py, neural_network.py,
and random_forest.py are containing the implementations of different algorithms. The
main.py is the main python file that we run the code.

In main.py, from line #107 to line #135 are print codes that can print out the results
of required information asked in the questions. To switch between different input files,
change the filename in line #107 and #108. while switching between different algorithms,
don't forget to change the algorithm name in line #108, so that it can properly deal with
the normalization problem. 

I tested the performance of my model suing the Titanic dataset and the Parkinsons dataset.
The performance can be seen in those graphs in this folder.
